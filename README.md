## SonicReducer

### Overview

This is a tiny library for reducing sequences in an hierarchical way. I mainly published this to teach myself how to
publish to maven, but you might nevertheless find it useful.

```
Array(1,2,3,4).reduceLeft(_ + _)

(((1+2)+3)+4)

Array(1,2,3,4).reduceRight(_ + _)

(1+(2+(3+4)))

Reducer.reduceArray(Array(1,2,3,4))

(1+2)+(3+4)
```
